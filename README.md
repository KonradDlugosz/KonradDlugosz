<h2>My Story</h2>
I always had interest in technology since I was young, my programming path started in high school where I learned python which led me into college where I created games in Unity using C#. Then this led me to go into Brunel University where I studied software engineering. I learnt different algorithms, some aspects of artificial intelligence, and data management, software engineering principles and learned how to code in java. I have collaborated with a team to create android application called travel suggestion, where I worked on front end, I design and implemented user interface and back-end architecture. I connected the application to server which hosted database. This was done using node.js I have also created web-based application that visualized covid-19 data and used machine learning to predict new infections which was also visualized using graphs. This was implemented using R and Shiny framework.
